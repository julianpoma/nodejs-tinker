# Node Tinker
I build a shop called Nodeshopee to practice NodeJS and ExpressJS basic stuff. Shop data is stored in a JSON file. CSS Styling is horrid.

## I want to test it out
1. Clone the Repo
2. `cd nodejs-tinker && npm install`
3. `node app.js`

If you have nodemon installed globally (`npm i -g nodemon`) you can run `npm start` instead.
